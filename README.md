This Valheim mod seeks to introduce the concept of Backpacks throughout the Valheim progression. Currently, 
Adventure Backpacks is a complete rewrite of the original Jotunn Backpacks 2.1.0+, which preserves the Rugged and Artic Backpacks
that you've come to enjoy.

## Roadmap
* v1.0.0 - Initial Release - Get existing functionality ported. (Completed)
* v1.3.0 - Mistlands Backpack - Introduce a new Backpack that when crafted will include the Feather Fall effect.
* v1.5.0 - Adventure Begins - Revamping all backpacks to be upgradable and offer new perks as upgrades happen. and offer backpacks at each 
stage of maturity. This includes a backpack progression that will start at Meadows and continue through Mistlands
* v2.0.0 - To be determined!
