# Current Patch Notes
# 1.6.2.0 - Bug Fixes and Mod Compatibility
* The last udpate introduced a Language Translation issue where it stopped loading Translation files.
    * This has been resolved. Apologies to my non-english friends!
* Additional Mod Compatibility changes.
    * Quick Stack Store would cause Thor to empty backpacks when using the Take All / Store All commands.
        * This has been fixed.
        * This **might** also fix an item dupping issue that is being experienced with Multi-User-Chests (not validated yet)
* This update also attempts to fix the Grid Not Displaying on Level 1 Wisppacks when opened on initial load of Valheim.

## 1.5.0.0
* Initial Release of Adventuring Backpacks introducing 6 New Backpack Prefabs (4 New Models and Designs)
    * The original two prefabs, have been identified as legacy items, that can no longer be built.  They will live on in your inventory as "Old".  Functionally, they'll exist as they have been.  But they aren't craftable, nor are they upgradeable.  (though they are configurable).
    * The 6 new Prefabs, introduce the 6 new bags that are intended to be used as progression bags.
    * The mod author would prefer that folks adventure in the world of Valheim and stumble across what it takes to craft the assortment of bags, however, those with less adventuring desires, may look at the configuration, where I do expose all of the recipes and what you have to touch in order to gain the recipes.  Yes, this also means that all of the bags are configurable for those that pack to the beat of a different drum.
    * The 6 new backpacks are:
        * **Satchel** - _A small backpack capable of holding things._
        * **Rugged Backpack**  - _A rugged backpack, complete with buckles and fine leather straps._
