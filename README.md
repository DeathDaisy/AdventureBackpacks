# Current Patch Notes

## 1.5.3.0
* Found another instance of Feather Fall not working. Fixed.
* Found a bug in the Epic Loot Augmenter when changing enchants.  Fixed.

## 1.5.2.0
* Fixing the Wisplight and Feathfall breaking because of previous fix. These now function as expected.
* Adding in French Translation Files (Thanks Renard!!)

## 1.5.1.0
* Fixed an annoying bug on the Level 4 Explorer's Wisppack where the Demister would activate on every equipment change. Annoying!
* Adjusted some shaders.

  * (Have you translated this into your language?  Let me know, and I'll add it the releases!)


## 1.5.0.0
* Initial Release of Adventuring Backpacks introducing 6 New Backpack Prefabs (4 New Models and Designs)
    * The original two prefabs, have been identified as legacy items, that can no longer be built.  They will live on in your inventory as "Old".  Functionally, they'll exist as they have been.  But they aren't craftable, nor are they upgradeable.  (though they are configurable).
    * The 6 new Prefabs, introduce the 6 new bags that are intended to be used as progression bags.
    * The mod author would prefer that folks adventure in the world of Valheim and stumble across what it takes to craft the assortment of bags, however, those with less adventuring desires, may look at the configuration, where I do expose all of the recipes and what you have to touch in order to gain the recipes.  Yes, this also means that all of the bags are configurable for those that pack to the beat of a different drum.
    * The 6 new backpacks are:
        * **Satchel** - _A small backpack capable of holding things._
        * **Rugged Backpack**  - _A rugged backpack, complete with buckles and fine leather straps._
